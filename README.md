# Bug Master: Streamlining Bug Management in Full Flight Simulator Operations


## Introduction

In the dynamic realm of full-flight simulator operations, where precision and safety are paramount, even the smallest glitch can have significant repercussions. Meet Bug Master â€“ a robust bug management system designed to optimize efficiency and minimize downtime in the face of software anomalies. Let's delve into the who, what, and why of Bug Master.

## Who is Who

At the heart of the system are key players: the prime customers, including pilot trainers and pilots, who rely on the full flight simulator for rigorous training exercises. Supporting them are engineers tasked with resolving bugs, quality assurance personnel tracking bug resolution times, front desk staff managing customer communication during downtimes, and subject matter experts standardizing rectification actions.

## Why Bug Management System

The urgency of addressing bugs promptly cannot be overstated. Every minute of downtime translates to lost opportunities and potential risks. Bug Master provides a structured framework for seamless bug resolution, ensuring that every role within the system operates with precision and accountability.

## Bug Master Schema

### Incident Master

The central repository updated by various roles, capturing essential details triggered by role-specific actions. This table serves as a comprehensive log of incidents, with a backup mechanism to safeguard data integrity.

### Bug Master

Engineers populate this table with crucial bug identifiers, system details, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) for resolution, laying the groundwork for swift action.

### Front Desk

Equipped with incident IDs, front desk personnel gauge customer urgency and update bug priorities accordingly, facilitating efficient resource allocation.

### Quality Team

Tasked with monitoring bug resolution metrics, the quality team records resolved times, total downtimes, and assigned engineers, ensuring accountability and continuous improvement.

### Engineering Master

Engineers document bug-specific details and resolution steps in this table, fostering a collaborative environment conducive to effective troubleshooting.

### Engineering SME

Drawing upon incident and bug IDs, subject matter experts offer insights and standardized solutions to eradicate bugs efficiently.

## Schematic Views

### Front Desk View

Columns: Incident_ID, Active Bug, related customer, ETA, and Standard ETA. Description: This view provides essential information for front desk personnel to manage customer interactions effectively. It retrieves data from the incident master table, including incident IDs, active bug status, associated customers, and expected time of resolution (ETA). Additionally, it incorporates a calculated field for Standard ETA, derived from historical data using aggregate functions and grouping by bug types.

### Engineer View

Columns: BugID, Engineer assigned, Knowledge_Base (Resolution). Description: Tailored for engineers tasked with resolving specific bugs, this view grants access to critical bug identifiers (BugID) and details of the assigned engineer. Additionally, engineers can leverage the Knowledge_Base table, linked to Bug_IDs, to access comprehensive information about bug resolutions, facilitating efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

### Quality Team View

Columns: Engineer assigned, Active bug ETA, Resolution steps. Description: Designed to empower quality assurance personnel with insights into bug resolution processes, this view presents information on engineers assigned to active bugs, along with their expected time of resolution (ETA). Furthermore, it provides visibility into the steps required to resolve specific bugs, enabling quality teams to monitor progress and ensure adherence to standardized protocols.
